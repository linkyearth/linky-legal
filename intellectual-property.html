  <h1>Intellectual Property Policy for Linky</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 15, 2024</p>

  <p>
    At Linky, we respect intellectual property rights and are committed to protecting the creative work of individuals and organizations.
    This Intellectual Property Policy outlines our approach to intellectual property protection, as well as your responsibilities as a Linky user.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Respect for Intellectual Property</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Only upload or share content you own, have permission to use, or that’s under a valid license (e.g., Creative Commons).</li>
    <li>You are fully responsible for ensuring your content doesn’t infringe on others’ copyrights, trademarks, patents, or IP rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. User-Generated Content and Ownership</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You retain ownership of your content when uploaded to Linky.</li>
    <li>You grant Linky a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable license to use, display, reproduce, and distribute your content within the platform (e.g., feeds, search, promotions).</li>
    <li>This license ends when your content is deleted—unless others have shared it and it remains active in their posts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Reporting Intellectual Property Infringement</h2>
  <p>If your IP rights have been violated on Linky, contact <a href="mailto:support@linky.earth">support@linky.earth</a> with the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A description of the work allegedly infringed.</li>
    <li>The specific URL or location where the infringement occurred.</li>
    <li>Proof of ownership or rights to the content.</li>
    <li>Your full contact info.</li>
    <li>A good-faith statement that the use is unauthorized.</li>
    <li>A declaration confirming the accuracy of your claim and authority to act on behalf of the IP owner.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Counter-Notice Process</h2>
  <p>If your content was removed in error, you may submit a counter-notice with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identification of the removed content and where it was located.</li>
    <li>A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the removal was a mistake or misidentification.</li>
    <li>Your name, address, and phone number, along with consent to jurisdiction in the complainant’s region.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Repeat Infringers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Repeated IP violations may result in account suspension or permanent bans.</li>
    <li>We track claims and counter-notices to enforce this policy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Copyright Agents and Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>We comply with global copyright regulations, including the DMCA.</p>
  <p>Designated DMCA Agent:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:copyright@linky.earth">copyright@linky.earth</a></li>
    <li><strong>Address:</strong> Linky.earth LLC, Copyright Department</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Use of Linky’s Intellectual Property</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Linky trademarks, logos, and branding are protected.</li>
    <li>Do not use Linky’s branding without prior written consent.</li>
    <li>When referencing Linky externally (e.g., blogs, videos), ensure the reference is accurate and does not imply endorsement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated. All changes will be reflected with an updated “Last Updated” date and posted here.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:support@linky.earth">support@linky.earth</a></li>
